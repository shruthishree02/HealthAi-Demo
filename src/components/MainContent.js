      summary: "This joint cream is very effective and does not cause any itching. My mother and I both found relief from knee pain after using it. I even recommended it to my mother's friend and sister, who also found it to be helpful. It works well for joint pain and has a pleasant scent. However, some people with allergies may not be able to use it on their face. Overall, it is a great product for relieving pain and has become a staple in my family for arthritis and muscle pain. Unfortunately, it did not provide any relief for various knee conditions as promised. Despite this setback, I highly recommend it for general joint pain and arthritis."
